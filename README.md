DESCRIPTION:I took Coursera because I was doing an NLP-based AI chatbot, and I felt that this teaching platform provided good, organized courses with thorough explanations of every step of the way. My aim was to build a chatbot that could understand and respond to human languages in a wise way.First off, I studied the basics of AI and NLP. I learned how chatbots process languages, identify keywords, and generate responses. Coursera courses explained concepts like machine learning, sentiment analysis, text processing, etc. in a simple way that helped me clear out core concepts.I then examined the training of the chatbot. Coursera introduced me to various techniques used for enhancing chatbot accuracy by means of NLU, i.e., natural language understanding, and intent recognition. These methods help the chatbot to understand what a person means even in case he or she posed the question in a different way.Then, I learned about the integration of chatbots. From the course on Coursera, I learned how a chatbot is integrated with various platforms, e.g., the web or different messenger apps, to make it interactable in real time. I also studied how AI models from one conversation to the other scope be improved with learning.Most interesting was how context and personalization are tackled by chatbots. On Coursera, I found an explanation for how modern AI chatbots could remember past performance interactions in an attempt to respond accordingly.By following the steps traced out by the Coursera lessons, I was able to craft the process into tiny doable steps. All of this provided me with a strong launching pad into the area of intelligent chatbot development, with NLP.
